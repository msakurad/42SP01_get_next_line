read from a file descriptor.

## Notes

### Final Grade: 112/100
Mandatory + Bonus (it passed the 3 evaluations I did with the Cadets but Moulinette couldn't compile it)

### Directories
-- includes
Contains the header "tests.h", which specifies all the libraries, functions used for the testing of libft functions.

-- srcs
Contains all the functions - including bonus- of the project.

-- srcs_old
Contains functions that I created but kept unfinished because I preferred to change the approach. In the end, I decided to keep those files for future inspiration.

-- tests
Contains the testing files associated to the get_next_line functions.

-- files_to_read
Contains the sample texts for the tests.

-- Unity (hidden)
Contains the necessary files of the Unity Testing Framework (Throw The Switch). Without it, I wouldn't be able to test the functions in an organized way.
